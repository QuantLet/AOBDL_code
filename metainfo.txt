Name of Quantlet : AOBDL

Published in : 'Antisocial Online Behavior Detection using Deep Learning'

Description : 'Antisocial Online behaivor detection. Contains data preparation for textual data in code_1_preparation.ipynb.
Moreover includes benchmarking on different models, traditional machine learning methods: ridge regression, SVM, random
forest, lightGBM, as well as deep learning models: GRU, LSTM, BGRU (bidirectional), BLSTM, BGRU + attention, BGRU + global
average pooling, BGRU + global maximum pooling. Furthermore contains semi-supervised DL models: self-training/pseudo labeling,
random assignment, tokenization on larger data set, rule-based approach,  cluster and label. Each notebook except 
code_1_preparation contains a model (or multiple), it reads data from the data folder, processes cross validation, 
as well as training on full training data and finally saves the weights.'
